      "description": "\"A Complete Guide To Creating A Profitable Recurring Income Through Membership Site\"\n\nBy bringing in more and more customers who pay a monthly fee for your content, your income stream will grow FAST.\n\nA membership site involves people paying a monthly fee to have access to private content.  This content is usually released at regular intervals, often weekly.\n\nNot only are membership sites EXTREMELY profitable, but by having a membership site, it puts you on the path of becoming an authority figure within your chosen niche.\n\nStarting a membership site is not nearly as difficult as you might think.  A lot of marketers get intimidated by the idea, thinking it is too big of an undertaking.  The truth is that there are a lot of great services and software options that make the task quite easy.  After the initial, often painless setup, all you really need to worry about is providing content and signing up new members.\n\nYou don’t even have to worry about having six or more months of content ready for your members.  Technically, you could start out with only the first week or two of content available on the site.  Just make sure you can add future content before they get done with what is currently there.  You don’t want members to get to a point where no content is available.  That’s the fastest way to start losing all your paying customers.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the whole point of a membership site is that you can automate almost everything.  When people sign up for your list and set up their payment, they will automatically be directed on how to get started.  You won’t need to create their account, or handle any of that.  All you will need to focus on is getting new members, and making sure your members have content on a weekly basis.\n\nWhen I say your members get content on a weekly basis, remember you only need to be making content for your oldest members.  You already have content ready for all of your other newer members, and it will automatically be delivered to them within the normal time frame.",

      "title": "10 Reasons to Increase Your Site Speed- Fast!",
      "description": "In November of 2020, Google added three new page experience signals that make up what is now being called Core Web Vitals. They include: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS),First Input Delay (FID) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). These three metrics were added into Google's ranking algorithm in mid-June 2021 and have since received a lot of buzz. If this is your first time hearing about Core Web Vitals, you can try Google Pagespeed Insights or alternatively GTMETRIX. Personally, I like to compare the results of both.\n\nMobile Browsing Speed\nWell before mobile device use surpassed desktop usage, browser loading speed on mobile devices has been an issue. Recent research done by Google shows that it takes the average website more than 15 seconds to load on a mobile device. The study also noted that conversion rates significantly dropped with every second that it took a website to load beyond 3 seconds.\n\nA Great Website Site That No One Sees\nImagine, your web designer builds you the most amazing website of all time. I mean, this website is beautiful! It checks all of the boxes; from a great site architecture and images to the most perfectly written and optimized content. You're now ready to conquer the world with your brand new, money printing machine. Then, guess what, your website is taking 15 seconds to load. All of your visitors quickly jump ship and click on your competitor's website, who has higher prices and lesser quality products. Chances are they won't be back. If that's not enough I'll give you 10 more reasons why you need to improve the loading speed of your website?\n\nMobile Device Use Exceeds Desktop Use\nIn 2016, StatCounter  released a study that found that mobile devices accounted for 51.3 percent of worldwide internet usage\n\nWebsites Load Slower On Mobile\nDesktop computers typically have better processors and internet connection speeds via wifi or ethernet. Even 5G mobile device data network are slower in most cases . This means that loading sites on mobile devices can be significantly slower than a desktop even when optimized for mobile\n\nWebsite Speed Is A Ranking Factor\nGoogle has publicly announced that a fast website helps to rank better. The ‘Speed Update’ made website speed a ranking factor for mobile searches.\n\nFast Websites Are Easier For Search Engines To Crawl\nThis was confirmed by a study of 413,000,000 pages at the 2018 SMX in Paris. https://www.slideshare.net/BotifySEO/how-does-google-crawl-the-web-botify-at-smx-paris-2018\n\nFast Loading Websites Have Higher Conversion Rates\nNumerous studies have revealed that faster page speed results in better conversions. To put it simply, the quicker a webpage loads, the more likely a user is to carry out the targeted call of action on that webpage. It was observed that at some. 2 seconds, conversion rates were less than 1% At 5. 7+ seconds, conversion rates were in the realm of 0. 6%\n\nWebsite Speed Reduces Bounce Rates\nThis one is no secret. If you've been around SEO for any length of time, you've heard how much page speed effects bounce rate.\n\nWebsite Speed Improves User Experience\nThe ultimate goal of any web design project should be to provide the best user experience for site visitors. As part of that, page speed is one of the most important.",
